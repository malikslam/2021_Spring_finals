### Variables Definition:
<ol> COVID-19 General Effect Variables: these are COVID-19 infection indicators that could to led to death. They are 
    'total_cases','new_cases', 'total_deaths','new_deaths'. </ol>
<ol> COVID-19 Preventive Variables: these are COVID-19  protective indicators. They are:
    'total_vaccinations', 'people_vaccinated', 'people_fully_vaccinated'.</ol>
<ol> COVID-19 Intensive Variables: these are COVID-19 infection indicators that led to hospital admission. </ol>


### Hypotheses:
<ol> H1: There is no significant relationship between COVID-19 Preventive Variables and COVID-19 General Effect Variable.</ol>
<ol> H2: There is no significant relationship between COVID-19 Intensive Variables and COVID-19 General Effect Variable. </ol>

### Preliminary Conclusion:
<p>There are strong indication in the above analysis that COVID-19 Prevention Variables and COVID-19 General Effect Variables are strongly related except for new cases and people_fully_vaccinated that is  0.421675; and new death and people_fully_vaccinated that is 0.365751, that are weakly correlated. Nevertheless, total_vaccinations have been strongly correlated all through.
Therefore, H1 is rejected which says:there is no significant relationship between COVID-19 Preventive Variables and COVID-19 General Effect Variable. </p>

Therefore, H2 is rejected which says:there is no significant relationship between COVID-19 Intensitive Variables and COVID-19 General Effect Variable.</p>
